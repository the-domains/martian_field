  Four Earth-years ago today, NASA's Curiosity rover successfully touched ground
  on Mars's dusty surface, after surviving a nail-biting descent through the red
  planet's thin atmosphere. Since its triumphant arrival, the car-size
  "laboratory on wheels" has traveled more than 8.4 miles (13.5 kilometers),
  taking pictures, collecting samples, and analyzing rocks along the way.
